  <!-- Answer the questions above here -->
  <h2>What does this program look like if done with a while loop? With a for loop? Which is better?</h2>
  <p>For my while loop, I have the user input in the loop while it's not correct. Once it is correct, it exits that loop and hits the if loop below it.  I think the while loop would probably serve better for this kind of loop, but I'm sure the for loop would be pretty handy as well.</p>
  
  <h2>Did you use == or ===? Does it matter?</h2>
  <p>I used == on mine, Without setting upcase/downcase guidelines, it doesn't matter in this case.</p>
