  <!-- Answer the 5 questions above here -->
  <h2>Given what you know so far, what are some reasons to use variables?</h2>
  <p>To hold data to use later on in our programs, and to store input the user gives us to work in our other defined methods.</p>
  
  <h2>What are some advantages to variable names like hairColor instead of hc (for example)? What are some disadvantages?</h2>
  <p>hairColor is more descriptive and easier to know what we are looking back at when we come back to code later on, but it is easier to misspell or get wrong when re-typing it out.  hc is easier in the typing out portion by saving keystrokes and might be somewhat intuitive depending on the context at the time, but a few months down the road it might be hard to remember what exactly we were doing setting a variable to hc.</p>
  
  <h2>Given what you know so far, what can you predict about other ways we might use variables?</h2>
  <p>To hold user input to use later on in a method or other output field, to store returns of methods in other methods.</p>
  
  <h2>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h2>
  <p>var is a keyword used just when defining a variable.  We don't need to use it again because by defining the var earlier using the keyword, our js compiler knows that the variable is defined, so we don't need the var again to redefine it.</p>
  
  <h2>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
  <p>In our alert example, setting an attribute without a value makes the browser return "undefined" as the value when we call the variable.  It doesn't return any error messages in the alert or in the console, and the program still works as intended otherwise.  It would be the equivalent of naming a variable in Ruby but leaving the value as nil.</p>
  
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>What do the different null/undefined values mean in JS, and why would you use each one?</p>
