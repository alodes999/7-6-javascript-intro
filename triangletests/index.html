  <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h2>
  <p>After testing, all it did was make the values come up false, and therefore return that it wasn't a valid triangle.  I was trying to have a return set up in case one of the values was input correctly, but for some reason that part of the if loop wasn't catching.  The problem was you can't compare if something is NaN.  Something that returns NaN isn't equal to NaN, so I had to test against if it was false for both less than or equal to 0 and false for greater than 0. </p>
  
  <h2>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h2>
  <p>My guess would be that it would be an invalid triangle, because one of the tests would fail.  After testing this is indeed what happened.</p>
  
  <h2>What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?</h2>
  <p>My guess here as well would be that it would fail and return the invalid triangle return.  This did bear out in testing.</p>
