  <!-- Answer the questions above here -->
  <h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h2>
  <p>It does matter.  Using either == or === required the password to be the correct capitalization.</p>
  
  <h2>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h2>
  <p>I used both == and === to test. = wouldn't work because that would set password to whatever the user entered, and you would always get the correct password box.</p>
  
  <h2>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h2>
  <p>You can probably pretty easily get the password through the console.</p>
