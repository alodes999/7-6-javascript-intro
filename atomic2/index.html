  <h1>JS Atomic 02</h1>

  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>alert() displays a pop-up box the user has to interact with to continue interacting with the site. console.log() sends messages to the console in the dev tools portion of the browser.</p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>You might have an alert pop up to tell the user they made a mistake when entering a form value, or some other notice the user NEEDS to see before continuing to do stuff on the site.</p>

  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>Having multiple alerts pop up to bug the user over and over would get annoying and obnoxious.  The fact they need to be clicked through before continuing on the site can make them very pesky at times.</p>

  <h2>Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
  <p>It would not, because for the most part users don't open the inspect element window to see the code or background elements on a page</p>
  
  <h2>What's one way that console.log() might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
  <p>It might be a good tool to use as a way to see what value gets passed through a method (function in js?) call.  It seems like it would be a helpful debugging tool.</p>
  
  <h2>When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert() gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>
  <p>They get run in the order listed in the code.  In our example, the first alert runs, the user clicks ok, then the console.logs and then the last alert.  I found out for sure by having the console open and reloading the site so it ran again.</p>
  
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>None so far!</p>
