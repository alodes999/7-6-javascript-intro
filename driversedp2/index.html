  <!-- Answer the questions above here -->
  <h2>Does it matter what order your if / else if statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?</h2>
  <p>It doesn't matter in the order the statements happen, because they're testing for which statement is true.  Reordering the elements still produces correct output, because there is only ever one true value.</p>
  
  <h2>What's wrong with this conditional: if (age < 16 && age > 21)?</h2>
  <p>There is no value that would make that conditional true, no number is both less than 16 and greater than 21.</p>
  
  <h2>Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your if statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?</h2>
  <p>It would be easy to change the variables to whatever it needs to be and just set the variables at the top.  That would make the code still work properly and yet not break when change is made.  It should matter because not everyone uses the same range of ages for this example.</p>
